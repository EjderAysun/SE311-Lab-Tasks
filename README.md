## General Info
* **Laboratory tasks**, **solutions**, and other **related documents** given each week are in the _relevant week's file_.
* This repo was created to share the solutions to the tasks and to facilitate the control of the solutions by the course assistant. In addition, it is developing by adding tasks and other relevant documents.

## Course Objectives[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+311)
The goal of this course to arm the students with the knowledge needed in _architecting_ **effective** and **maintainable** _complex software systems_ of high quality by applying _design patterns_. Each pattern represents a _best practice solution_ to a software problem in some context. The course will _sensitize_ the student that there is **rarely one "right" design** and an engineer is faced with a _spectrum of possibilities_ representing tradeoffs. The course will cover the **rationale** and **benefits of design patterns** in _architecting software systems_. The course includes a brief review of **object-oriented design principles** and **UML**. Programming assignments and a project in the _Java_ language will provide experience in the use of these patterns.

## Learning Outcomes[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+311)
- _The students who succeeded in this course_;
  - Be able to **state the intention of the pattern** and **show in UML notation**,
  - Be able to **identify the participants and their responsibilities**,
  - Be able to **contrast the difference in intentions between structurally similar patterns**,
  - Be able to **apply several appropriate patterns in the design of small programming assignments**,
  - Be able to **select appropriate design patterns to improve an existing design**.

## Inspiration
Software Engineering 311 (SE 311) LAB Instructions (Izmir University of Economics, 2024, SE 311 course, Spring Semester laboratory tasks)
  
As a student of the Izmir University of Economics, I made these tasks in accordance with the SE 311 laboratory tasks instructions for the spring semester laboratory tasks of the SE 311 course in 2024.
  
The repo conforms almost exactly to the document. It is highly personalized.
  
I share documents publicly. The contents of the SE 311 projects that will be given in the future may be similar to this document. If you have an ethical responsibility based on this or a similar course, assignment, or task, please use this as an opinion only. If you have a question or need more information about the solutions, send an email to me: <ejderaysunn@gmail.com>
